    <p>
      A <strong>blockchain</strong> is a type of
      <mark>Digital Ledger Technology (DLT)</mark> that
      <del>consists</del> command of growing list of records, called blocks,
      that are securely linked together using cryptography.<sup
        >[1][2][3][4]</sup
      >
      Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a
      timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree,
      where data nodes are represented by leafs). The timestamp proves that the
      transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block
      contains information about the block previous to it, they effectively form
      a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block
      linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are
      irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block
      cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.<br /><br />

      Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network
      for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to
      a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks.
      Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks
      are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify
      a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.<sup
        >[5]</sup
      >

      <br /><br />The blockchain was created by a person (or group of people)
      using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008<sup>[6]</sup> to
      serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency
      transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta,
      and Dave Bayer.<sup>[7]</sup> The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains
      unknown to date. The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made
      it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without
      the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has
      inspired other applications<sup>[3][2]</sup> and blockchains that are
      readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The
      blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.<sup>[8]</sup>

      <br /><br />Private blockchains have been proposed for business use.
      Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without
      a proper security model "snake oil";<sup>[9]</sup> however, others have
      argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more
      decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless
      ones.<sup>[4][10]</sup>

      Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his
      1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted
      by Mutually Suspicious Groups."<sup>[11]</sup> Further work on a
      cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart
      Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.<sup>[4][12]</sup>

      They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be
      tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated
      Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing
      several document certificates to be collected into one block.<sup
        >[4][13]</sup
      >
      Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been
      published in The New York Times every week since 1995.<sup>[14]</sup>

      The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or
      group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the
      design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp
      blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and
      introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks
      are added to the chain.<sup>[4]</sup> The design was implemented the
      following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency
      bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the
      network.<sup>[3]</sup>

      In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of
      all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB
      (gigabytes).<sup>[15]</sup>

      In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016
      to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size.
      The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.<sup>[16]</sup>

      The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's
      original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word,
      blockchain, by 2016.<sup>[17]</sup>

      According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations
      theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within
      financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters'
      phase.<sup>[18]</sup> Industry trade groups joined to create the Global
      Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital
      Commerce. In May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any
      kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of
      CIOs were in the short-term "planning or [looking at] active
      experimentation with blockchain".<sup>[19]</sup> For the year 2019 Gartner
      reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a 'game-changer'
      for their business.<sup>[20]</sup>

    <p>
      A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital
      ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used to record
      transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be
      altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent
      blocks.<sup>[3][21]</sup> This allows the participants to verify and audit
      transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.<sup>[22]</sup> A
      blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network
      and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass
      collaboration powered by collective self-interests.<sup>[23]</sup> Such a
      design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty
      regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the
      characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It
      confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the
      long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described
      as a value-exchange protocol.<sup>[24]</sup> <br />A blockchain can
      maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange
      agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.<sup
        >[citation needed]</sup

    </p>

    <p>
      Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:<sup

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Blocks</h2>
    <p>
      Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into
      a Merkle tree.[3] Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior
      block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a
      chain.[3] This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous
      block, all the way back to the initial block, which is known as the
      genesis block (Block 0).[27][28] To assure the integrity of a block and
      the data contained in it, the block is usually digitally signed.[29]
      Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a
      temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain
      has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so
      that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not
      selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.[28] Peers
      supporting the database have different versions of the history from time
      to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known
      to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the
      old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their
      own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never
      an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best
      version of history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the
      score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend
      with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the
      probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially[30] as
      more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.
      [3][31]: ch. 08 [32] For example, bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system,
      where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the
      valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used
      to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation. Within a blockchain the
      computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional
      segregated and parallel manner.[33]
    </p>

    <h3>Block time</h3>
    <p>
      The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate
      one extra block in the blockchain. Some blockchains create a new block as
      frequently as every five seconds.[34] By the time of block completion, the
      included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically
      when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster
      transactions. The block time for Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15
      seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.[35]
    </p>

    <h3>Hard forks</h3>
    <p>This section is an excerpt from Fork (blockchain) § Hard fork.[edit]</p>
    <p>
      A hard fork is a rule change such that the software validating according
      to the old rules will see the blocks produced according to the new rules
      as invalid. In case of a hard fork, all nodes meant to work in accordance
      with the new rules need to upgrade their software. If one group of nodes
      continues to use the old software while the other nodes use the new
      software, a permanent split can occur.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, Ethereum was hard-forked in 2016 to "make whole" the
      investors in The DAO, which had been hacked by exploiting a vulnerability
      in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum
      and Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to
      consider a hard fork that would have led to a rollback of the blockchain
      records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major
      cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of
      the funds were recovered after negotiations and ransom payment.
      Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the
      new software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split
      on 12 March 2013.[36]
    </p>

    <p>
      A more recent hard-fork example is of Bitcoin in 2017, which resulted in a
      split creating Bitcoin Cash.[37] The network split was mainly due to a
      disagreement in how to increase the transactions per second to accommodate
      for demand.[38]
